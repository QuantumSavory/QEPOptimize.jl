# QEPOptimize.jl

A framework for optimization of entanglement purification circuits based on the [BPGates.jl simulator](https://github.com/QuantumSavory/BPGates.jl/), following methods published in ["Optimized Entanglement Purification"](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2019-02-18-123/) and ["Faster-than-Clifford simulations of entanglement purification circuits and their full-stack optimization"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-024-00948-0).

The examples folder contains a Pluto notebook with a user-friendly UI for generating optimized entanglement distillation circuits and lists how the public API of this library is to be used.
